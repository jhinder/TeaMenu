# TeaMenu
A simple menu bar tea timer for macOS.

## How to use it
Download the application or compile it from sources. The app sits in the menu bar.

You can select one of the predefined teas (the list of teas can be edited) or start a quick tea timer (tip: the slider can also be moved with a mouse or trackpad).  
Once the timer is up a notification will show up, either as a small notification window or in the Notification Centre (can be configured in the menu).

## System requirements
The app will run on macOS 10.9 and later.

To open the Xcode project, you need Xcode 9 or later.

Up to version 1.2 the program also ran on Mac OS X 10.6 (or later).
Additionally the last commit that compiles on SL is tagged as `snow-leopard`.
These previous versions can be compiled with Xcode 4.2 (or later).
