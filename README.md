# TeaMenu
A simple menu bar tea timer for Mac OS X.

## System requirements
TeaMenu doesn't require much. All you need is a 64-bit Mac with Mac OS X 10.6 or newer. To compile, you need Xcode 4.2 (or later).

## Translations
So far, the app is available in English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch and Swedish, and soon some more. There may be some translation mistakes because I can't speak every language, of course. If you want to add/improve languages, feel free to do so.

## Licence
TeaMenu is licenced under the MIT licence. See the LICENSE file for details.
