#TeaMenu

A simple menu bar tea timer for Mac OS X.

## System requirements
TeaMenu doesn't require much. All you need is a 64-bit Mac with Mac OS X 10.6 or newer. To compile, you need Xcode 4.2 (or later).

## Translations
So far, the app is available in English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch and Swedish, and soon some more. There may be some translation mistakes because I can't speak every language, of course. If you want to add/improve languages, feel free to do so.

## Usage Info
The data I collect about you is tiny: your Mac OS X version number, and your computer's current language. No personal data is being sent. The app will ask if you want to participate at first startup.  
If you want to take a look at the code behind this, it's inside `sendAnonymousSystemInfo` in `AppDelegate.m`.
